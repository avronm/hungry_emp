# HungryEmp

![](preview.gif?raw=true)

## Description

An Elixir Pheonix application allowing the filtering of San Francisco's food truck open dataset locations based on the food items served.

In order to build the code in this repo, you'd need a few dependencies installed on your machine. The steps for setting this up can be found [here](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html).

Then, to start the Phoenix server in this repo:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you should be able to visit [`localhost:4000/eat`](http://localhost:4000/eat) from your browser. There, you should be presented a view similar to that of the preview shown above. You will then be able to use the input presented on the page to filter the locations based on the type of food they wish to eat.


Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
